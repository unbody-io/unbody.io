In the era of digital transformation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands at the forefront, promising to revolutionize how we derive insights and build impactful applications. However, the journey to unlocking AI's full potential begins with a fundamental resource: data.

Any AI application starts with data, but our data is often scattered across a digital landscape – think emails, documents, social media, cloud storage, and more. This fragmentation is the first hurdle in our AI journey. It hinders our ability to harness AI effectively, as meaningful insights remain locked within isolated data islands.

## Challange1: The Data Integration Challenge

Effective AI requires bringing together data from various sources. Yet, integrating data from different platforms can feel like navigating a maze. Each platform has its unique way of storing data, with different formats and rules. The task of connecting to each platform and preparing data for AI use is not only complex but also time-consuming and expensive.

## Challange2: Understanding Data in Context

Imagine the potential insights lying dormant within your presentations on SharePoint, their true value only emerging when considered in the context of related Outlook emails. Similarly, blog posts on Google Drive find deeper insights into the code repositories on GitHub. Each data point is a piece of the puzzle, and isolation keeps the picture incomplete. This is where big platforms like Google and Microsoft, despite offering AI functionalities, fall short.

## Limitations of Large Platforms

While big platforms offer some AI integration solutions, they come with their own set of limitations:

- **High Costs**: Their AI solutions are often prohibitively expensive, especially for small to medium-sized businesses.
- **Data Silos**: These platforms tend to maintain data in isolation, obstructing a holistic view of your information.
- **Limited AI Model Options**: There's a restriction to using their AI models, limiting exploration and application of potentially more suitable AI solutions.

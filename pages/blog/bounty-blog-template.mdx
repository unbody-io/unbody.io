### Overview

Unbody is seeking UI designers for an exciting challenge: to reimagine blogging platforms for the AI age. We're creating an open-source blogging template that fully integrates and showcases AI functionalities, setting a new standard for content interaction and presentation.

### Objective

Design a user interface that isn't just AI-compatible, but one that is built from the ground up to harness and showcase Unbody's AI capabilities. This template will be a benchmark in how AI can transform the blogging experience.

### Who Should Apply

This bounty is specifically for UI designers passionate about crafting the future of blogging, and keen on exploring how AI can redefine user interaction in content platforms.

### AI Functionalities to Focus On

- **Semantic Search**: Enabling users to find content through contextual understanding.
- **Generative Search**: Leveraging AI to create and suggest content based on user queries.
- **Visual Search**: Incorporating AI-powered image and video search capabilities.

### Design Style

The template should have a futuristic and sleek design, yet remain versatile and generic enough to appeal to a wide range of audiences. It should intuitively convey the power and sophistication of AI-driven functionalities.

### Key Components

1. **Index Page**: A dynamically AI-driven interface showcasing a variety of blog posts.
2. **Search Functionality**: Advanced, AI-integrated search features accessible within the blog.
3. **Post Page**: Innovative layouts for different types of posts, all enhanced by AI capabilities.

### Deliverables

- **Round 1:**
  - Initial concepts with visual references and a brief on how they integrate AI functionalities.
- **Round 2:**
  - Detailed UI design for the entire template, focusing on usability and AI integration.
  - Final designs are to be delivered in Figma or Framer, ready for implementation.

### **Compensation**

- **Cash Reward**: $500 for the selected design.
- **Credit**: Designers will be credited in the footer of every blog that uses this template.

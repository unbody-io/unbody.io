From this point on, everyone —yes, everyone— wants apps that understand their data like humans.

But making A.I. apps isn't easy.

The real challenge is in the development process.

---
Creating AI apps is tough. Seriously though. And if you're a developer, you know exactly what I mean. If I got you interested keep reading because, in the end, you as a non-ai developer would not feel excluded from AI development.

### Big elephant in the room

Remember when ChatGPT hit the scene? Suddenly, AI wasn't just for techies. It showed everyone the power of AI, making us all want more human-like interactions with our apps. We're not just talking about faster data processing; we're talking about apps that understand and respond like a person. That's a game-changer.

But here's the kicker: blending these AI capabilities with your unique content? That's where it gets hairy. And that’s what's driving this whole new shift in how we interact with technology.

### Challenge 1 - Personalisation

We've all been amazed by AI's chat prowess, right? But when it comes to really getting personal, things get tricky. These AIs are schooled in general knowledge, thanks to being fed loads of public data. But your data? That's a different story. It's unique, private, and not something these AI models are familiar with.

It's not just feeding them data; it's teaching them to recognize the subtleties that make your data distinct. This leap from generic to personal is tough. We’re talking about a system that needs to be smart enough to adapt to your specific needs, all while keeping things private and secure. That's a tall order.

### Challenge 2 - Your data: where it lives and its many faces

Now, let's talk about your own data. We expect AI to understand it, but first, we need to see where this data actually lives and in what shape it is. Our digital lives are scattered – emails, Dropbox, Google Drive, social media, Slack, Discord, local devices... it's a kaleidoscope of data forms. And AI? It struggles with this mishmash.

Each data type – text, images, audio – has its own language, and they're stored in different corners of our digital world. For AI to really make sense of it, it needs to be a jack-of-all-trades. And that's no small feat. The challenge is to make AI savvy enough to navigate and understand these varied data landscapes without making us change our habits. After all, we want AI to fit into our lives, not the other way around.

### Challenge 3 - The developer's tightrope

*A regular tech stack for a simple chatbot - from [@aigeek__](https://x.com/aigeek__/status/1717046220714308026)*

So, we've talked about the challenges of personalizing AI and dealing with our scattered, diverse data. But here's where things really get interesting for developers. This is where the rubber meets the road.

Diving into the heart of AI app development, developers face quite a puzzle. Picture this: you're building a chatbot drawing data from Google Drive and Slack. You start mixing tools like LangChain, vector databases, and LlamaIndex with a dash of RAG APIs and vectorizers. Before you know it, you're juggling query languages and document parsers. It's like opening a toolbox and finding tools you never knew existed. You see, this is already getting out of hand, isn't it?

*The decisions you have to make when it comes to building LLM app - [Jery liu - CEO of LlamaIndex](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/introducing-llama-packs-e14f453b913a)*

The real trick is not just understanding these tools but making them play nicely together. It's a bit like conducting an orchestra where each musician is playing a different tune. That's the challenge here, and it's exactly why Unbody was born – to make this symphony a bit more harmonious, turning what could be a tech headache into a more manageable and even fun endeavor in AI app development.

**Tying it all together: the cascade of challenges**

Now, let's take a step back and see how these challenges are interconnected, leading to a pivotal pain point for developers. First, we have the personalization challenge – making AI understand your unique data. Then comes the issue of diverse data storage and formats. These two combine to form a complex landscape that developers must navigate. Add to this the intricate web of AI tools and technologies, and you have a perfect storm. It's a cascade of challenges, each feeding into the next, culminating in a significant hurdle: making AI practical and accessible for all developers, not just the AI gurus.

Before we dive into how Unbody simplifies this, let's decode some buzzwords. This way, we're all on the same page, and you won't feel lost in the AI jargon jungle.

- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Think of LLMs as the brain behind AI that understands and generates human-like text. They're the wizards of language, trained to interpret and respond just like a person would.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: This is like giving AI a research assistant. RAG helps AI pull in extra information from user's various data sources to make its responses even smarter.
- **ML (Machine Learning)**: ML is where computers learn from data to make decisions and predictions. It's like teaching a computer to think and learn from experience.
- **Vectorizing and Embeddings**: This is about converting different types of data (like text or images) into a format that AI can understand and work with. Think of it as translating human language into AI language.
- **Multimodal**: This refers to AI's ability to understand and process more than one type of data – like text, images, and sound – all at once.
- **Vector Database**: Imagine a super-smart library where AI can store and retrieve complex data. Vector databases are designed for the kind of multi-dimensional data that AI needs to function effectively.

With this foundation laid, we're ready to dive into how Unbody addresses these challenges, making AI app development not just a possibility but a pleasure for all developers.

## Let’s put all fancy words in one box

Still with me? Navigating AI development can seem daunting, but that's exactly why Unbody is here. Our solution is straightforward; we put all those complex AI terms and intricate tasks into one, magical box. Think of Unbody as an invisible AI layer, a headless API: just tell Unbody where your data lives — any place, any format — and she takes it from there. Unbody will automatically aggregate, sync, and transform your data into advanced AI functionalities, all accessible through a single GraphQL endpoint.

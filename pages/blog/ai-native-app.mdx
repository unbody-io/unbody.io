It’s been a while since AI and in particular large language models have become known and found their way into our daily lives. This technology has affected the way we as users interact with the machine/software, we have learned that we can speak to the machine now, and we can make a dialog with the software and the data. Such a shift in the user's mental model requires a shift in how we design and build software. Soon ***“AI-first”** will become the new **“mobile-first”*** [^1], and In this post, chatbots, semantic searches, multimodal generative features, and all other AI functionalities will be expected in every website. I’m going to dive into what it means to be "AI-first." and how we at Unbody aim to create a foundation for building AI-native apps for non-ai developers.

When we talk about an AI-first app or website, we're referring to platforms that either integrate AI functionalities or are developed from the ground up as AI-native digital products. Before we start with the characteristics of AI-native products, it’s crucial to set the context of our discussion.

The journey of any AI application begins with data, which may be general public knowledge or specific to a particular domain. Our focus here is on AI-native apps that leverage domain-specific data. This distinction is important because while it’s possible to build numerous applications using AI models like OpenAI's GPTs, the real challenge lies in the unique value proposition offered by your product. What does your app provide that general AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini chat, with their extensive plugins, do not? The answer often lies in the utilization of private or specialized data that sets your offering apart from the rest.

With this understanding, let’s explore the three main pillars that I believe characterize an AI-native app.

## AI-native characteristics

### **1. Data**

When it comes to building apps and websites, everything starts with data, ranging from simple static company websites to complex SaaS products aimed at providing tailored advice on creating better resumes. Traditionally, we have organized this information using content management systems (CMS) to create, curate, and manage the necessary data in a highly structured format. This process often involves extensive manual effort, including copious amounts of copying and pasting, manual data entry, and content analysis.

![data.jpg](/images/blog/ai-native/data.jpg)

In the context of AI-native apps, we can approach data management differently. When examining any app or website more closely, it's evident that much of the information displayed, such as about pages, FAQ sections, blog posts, or documentation, already exists in some form elsewhere—perhaps as a PDF, a Google Doc, a markdown file or one of our email to another customer. Conventionally, we would need to re-curate this content to fit the structured data requirements of our platforms, while also manually applying SEO tags, assigning keywords, highlighting named entities, and adding captions to images.

However, with AI-native applications, we bypass these traditional steps. We do not need to re-structure “structured” and “unstructured” data to build websites or apps. Instead, we use AI to save us the hassle of this data transformation. AI allows us to maintain data in its original format and location, utilizing language models to adapt it to our needs effectively.

This process requires the capability to aggregate and process documents, files, and data from all different locations and platforms in all formats.

### **2. Context**

The second crucial aspect of AI-native apps is the context in which content exists. Traditionally, all content that needed to be communicated had to be explicitly written out. However, we know that every piece of content inherently possesses a context—it’s not isolated but linked to other data points that have been created at some time or another. This interconnected nature of content is the principle behind Hypertext, which is used in virtually every web page today. Traditionally, making these connections is a manual process, which not only consumes a lot of time but also often results in missing links and lost information.

![context.jpg](/images/blog/ai-native/context.jpg)

Consider your technical documentation: you might spend months crafting detailed documents, but is that the only source of truth? Does it answer every possible question? What about the repeated queries that have already been addressed in community discussions on platforms like Slack or GitHub? Or the technical debates that unfold on forums like Discourse? Even a straightforward document connects to numerous other data points, which can enrich the content and provide a fuller experience. Making these connections between different "islands" of information is what we define as context—a critical element for any AI-native application.

To do this effectively, it's not enough just to aggregate data; we need the ability to semantically connect topics with each other. This is where advanced features like "semantic search" play a vital role. Semantic search allows for a deeper understanding and linking of content, enabling apps to provide responses and information that are contextually connected beyond simple keyword matching.

### **3. User Experience model**

With the rise of AI and large language models, we're seeing a fundamental shift in daily interactions with technology. Users are no longer just seeking information; they're looking for immediate answers. This shift introduces a new way of thinking about both content creation and consumption. Now, users expect to communicate with apps and websites through conversation, not just by clicking through options.

Moreover, there is a growing preference for using natural human language when interacting with software. This requires our apps to not only understand but also respond in human language. It affects how we design and develop apps—adjusting user experience strategies and developing capabilities for deeper semantic analysis.

To support this interactive approach, we need to implement features like generative search, image captioning, content classification, chatbots, and visual search. These capabilities are essential as we develop AI-native apps that cater to the evolving expectations of users, providing seamless, intuitive interactions. This is what we aim for as we advance in the field of AI-driven applications.

## What this mean in technical terms

![challangfe.jpg](/images/blog/ai-native/challangfe.jpg)

Now that we've talked about what makes an app AI-first, let’s get into the tech that makes it all possible. We break down the essential tech into three main areas:

1. **Data Aggregation**: This is all about getting data from different places and making sure it all syncs up nicely.
2. **Data Processing**: We need to turn raw data into enhanced AI-ready data. This stage includes various tasks including cleaning data, chunking, vectorizing and some post-processing tasks such as entity recognition, classification and/or summary generation.
3. **functions**: I am borrowing this division here from what is famously known as RAG but here we would go beyond that, since we do not want to get too technical and too specific:
 - **Data Retrieval**: Think of it as a supercharged search engine inside your app, helping you find exactly what you need quickly.
 - **Data Augmentation**: This is about making the existing data even better, like adding new details to it or tweaking it to help the app understand different scenarios better.
 - **Data Generation**: Borrowing a bit from something called the RAG—Retrieval-Augmented Generation—we go beyond just pulling out existing info. We create new bits of content right on the spot based on what users are asking for. It’s about giving users not just what they asked for but also what they might need next.

## Challenge

Alright, if you're curious about how all this comes together, here’s a peek at what it looks like to assemble a system that can handle everything we’ve discussed.

![Untitled](/images/blog/ai-native/Untitled.png)

First off, you’ll likely need to be familiar with Python—it’s essential for handling the kind of tasks we’re talking about. You’ll be putting together a system that includes about ten different components. These components range from document parsers and embeddings to deploying Large Language Models via an API, as well as data aggregation, data cleaning, chunking, and integrating tools like Langchain.

But the challenge doesn’t stop there; these are just the AI-related elements. For building fully functional real-world apps and websites, you'll need a whole lot more. We're talking about incorporating functionalities like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), video and audio hosting, and maybe even image processing for responsive images. All these elements are crucial to ensure your app or website performs well across all platforms and user environments.

## Our solution

At unbody we have fixed this. We tried to build ai native websites and we saw how challenging it is. Unbody is developing an AI-as-a-service platform that automates the entire AI development pipeline, making it straightforward for developers to integrate advanced AI functionalities into their applications. As the demand for "AI-first" capabilities becomes as crucial as "mobile-first" was, developers face significant challenges with scattered data across multiple platforms and complex AI technologies that are typically not accessible to those without specialized knowledge.

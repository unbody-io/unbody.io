How is Unbody different from IFTTT or Zapier?

> Unbody offers a unique alternative to traditional Content Management Systems (CMSs) and streamlines the process of publishing content on the web by eliminating the need for a CMS as a content management interface. In the following sections, we'll compare Unbody to other solutions such as CMSs, Zapier, and IFTTT.
> ### Unbody vs CMS
> While Unbody functions like a headless CMS, it's not a CMS in the traditional sense. Unlike other CMSs that come with a built-in interface for managing content, Unbody gives you the flexibility to manage your website's content through any interface of your choice. Other CMSs, such as Contentful, Strapi, and Netlify CMS, all have built-in interfaces for managing content, but they can be limiting and require additional effort to use effectively. With Unbody, you can use the tools and interfaces you're already familiar with, such as Google Drive or Slack, to manage your content.
> ### Unbody vs Zappier or IFTTT
> While Unbody and automation tools like Zapier and IFTTT both automate tasks between apps, Unbody is specifically designed for managing and displaying website content. It offers unique features like semantic search and powerful image processing, and lets you use any platform you already use as your CMS.

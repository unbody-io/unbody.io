# Overview 
When working with machine learning models, and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), it is often necessary to convert data into a numerical format. This is because machine learning models require numerical data to perform computations.
The vectotization can be applied to text data, image data, and other types of data. Unbody provides a variety of vectorizers for different types of data including text data, image data, and video data.

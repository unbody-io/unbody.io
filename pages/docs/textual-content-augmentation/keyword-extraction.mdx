# Keyword Extraction

Keyword extraction enables you to extract key terms and entities from your text data.

The Named Entity Recognition (NER) module classifies tokens in text, identifying entities such as names, locations, and organizations.

There are two types of keyword extraction available as given below.

### On-demand:

- **Usage**: You can manually trigger keyword extraction through API requests, specifying the `tokens` filter in the `_additional` field.
- **Benefit**: It provides real-time extraction, allowing for flexible application as needed.

### Automatic:

- **Usage**: In this case, keywords are automatically extracted as content is ingested and synchronized, becoming immediately accessible in the `tokens` field.
- **Benefit**: The benefits include streamlining data retrieval, and offering pre-extracted keywords for efficiency.

# Summary Generation

This module has the ability to transform lengthy paragraphs into concise and informative summaries.

### On-demand:

- **Usage**: You can manually trigger summary generation in real-time via API requests, specifying the `summary` filter in the `_additional` field.
- **Benefit**: This module offers you the flexibility to apply summarization as and when required. Thus it helps in conserving computational resources.

### Automatic:

- **Usage**: If you choose automatic, summaries are generated and stored as content is ingested. These summaries are available instantly in the `summary` field.
- **Benefit**: It enhances data retrieval speed with pre-generated summaries and also ensures immediate access.

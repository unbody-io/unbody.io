# Get started with Unbody
Unbody automates the entire backend process needed to build AI-native applications or features, all through a single API. Acting as a headless API, Unbody seamlessly pulls data from any source, regardless of format, processes it using your choice of AI models, and delivers the enhanced data back to you via a GraphQL API or one of our SDKs.

## Before you begin
To get started, sign up for an Unbody account and [select the plan](https://unbody.io/pricing) that best fits your needs.

## Get started
The guide is divided into two chapters: the first chapter covers setting up Unbody and your project, while the second focuses on using the Unbody API.

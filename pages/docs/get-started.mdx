# Get started with Unbody

Unbody is a platform that automates the entire backend development process you need to build AI-native applications or functionalities, in one API.

Unbody functions as a headless API, which grabs data from any location and in any format, and then processes it with your own choice of AI models, and then return the enhanced data to you via a GraphQL API or one of our SDKs.

## Before you begin
To get started, create an account with Unbody. You can [select the plan](https://unbody.io/pricing) that's right for you.

## Get started
The guide is divided into two chapters: the first chapter covers setting up Unbody and your project, while the second focuses on using the Unbody API.

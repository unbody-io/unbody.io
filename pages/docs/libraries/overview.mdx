Apart from our graphql endpoint, we are trying to offer our functionalities via various SDKs in order to make the development process even easier.

The general mission behind SDKs is to simplify the methods exposed via our graphql endpoint even further by extracting away non-ai developer friendly concepts. There is an open conversion here on [our Github](https://github.com/unbody-io/ts-client/issues/7).

Currently we have a [typescript](/docs/libraries/typescript-client). We are planning to add more SDKs in the future.

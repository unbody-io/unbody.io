# Getting Started

Hello folks, we welcome you to Unbody. Unbody helps you to transform content from different providers to accessible knowledge using a simple existing interface. You can aggregate and synchronize content from a wide variety of sources such as a Google Drive document, a Slack channel, a folder, or a file on your laptop.

Here are simple steps to get you started to transform your content into an accessible knowledge base.

## 1. Access Your Dashboard

You can access your [Unbody Dashboard here](https://app.unbody.io/). You need to log in to get started.

## 2. Create a Project

Your project on Unbody is the workspace that allows you to maintain and manage your content sources. You can create your first project directly from the dashboard.

## 3. Connect Your Content Sources

Once you have set up your project, you can connect your content sources. Unbody currently supports Google Drive and Google Calendar. We are working on more integrations, which shall be available to you soon.

You can add a source by following the steps given below.

<Steps>
### Step 1
 
**Select a provider:** Choose the platform where you have stored your content. For example, if your content is stored in Google Drive, choose it as the content provider. You can visit [Google Drive](/docs/google-drive) and [Google Calendar](/docs/google-calendar) for more information.
 
### Step 2
 
 **Authorize Unbody:** You must allow Unbody to access your content from the selected provider. Please read more about this on our [privacy page](https://unbody.io/privacy).

### Step 3

**Set an entry point:** In this step, you need to specify where Unbody should start indexing your content. For example, you can specify a folder or an agenda.

</Steps>

## 4. Initialize Your Content

Now you can navigate to the source page and click “initialize”. Unbody will index the content from your entry point. Once the process is completed, the dashboard will display the number of records processed.

## 5. Explore the GraphQL Playground

Now that your content is initialized successfully, you can directly jump to the [GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/testing/graphql-playground/) and get your hands dirty, craft your queries, and watch the magic. We have given some tailored examples for Google Drive content.

- **Basic Query - Fetching Google Doc Details**

With the query given below, you can retrieve the name and text content from a Google Doc.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```graphql copy
query {
  Get {
    GoogleDoc {
      originalName
      text
    }
  }
}
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

- **Retrieve Media Blocks**

To access URLs and attributes for ImageBlocks and AudioFiles, you can use the query given below.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```graphql copy
query {
  Get {
    ImageBlock {
      url
      alt
      width
    }
    AudioFile {
      url
      size
      ext
    }
  }
}
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

- **Semantic Search**

You can perform the search operation using the query given below. For example, the query discovers TextBlocks conceptually related to "fashion".

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```graphql copy
query {
  Get {
    TextBlock(nearText: { concepts: ["fashion"] }) {
      text
    }
  }
}
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

- **Advanced Q&A**

The query given below helps you extract a specific answer from a Google Doc.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```graphql copy
query {
  Get {
    GoogleDoc(
      ask: { question: "What is Unbody's core feature?", properties: "text" }
    ) {
      _additional {
        answer {
          result
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

# Getting Started

Hello folks, we welcome you to Unbody. Unbody helps you to transform content from different providers to accessible knowledge using a simple existing interface. You can aggregate and synchronize content from a wide variety of sources such as a Google Drive document, a Slack channel, a folder, or a file on your laptop.

Here are simple steps to get you started to use Unbody.

<Steps>
    ### Start with the dashboard

    You can access your [Unbody Dashboard here](https://app.unbody.io/). You need to sing-in/sing-up to get started.

    ### Create a Project

    Your project on Unbody is the workspace that allows you to maintain and manage your content sources. You can create
    your first project directly from the dashboard.
    When you create a project, you will be asked to configure the following:
    - **Project Name:** Give a name to your project.
    - **Vectorization Model:** Choose the model that best suits your content. You can read more about this on our
    [Vectorization Models](/docs/vectorizers/overview) page.
    - **AI functionalities:** You can enable/disable as well as configure AI engine for different functionalities like
    generative Q&A, Geneartive Search, etc.

    ### Connect Your Content Sources

    Once you have set up your project, you can connect your content sources (e.g; Google Drive or Discord).
    You can add a source by following the steps given below.

    <Steps>
        ### Select a provider

        Choose the platform where you have stored your content. For example, if your content is
        stored in Google Drive, choose it as the content provider. You can visit
        [providers](/docs/providers/overview) for more information.

        ### Authorize Unbody

        You must allow Unbody to access your content from the selected provider. Please read more
        about this on our [privacy page](https://unbody.io/privacy).

        ### Set an entry point

        In this step, you need to specify where Unbody should start indexing your content. For
        example, you can specify a folder or an agenda.

    </Steps>

    ### Initialize Your Content

    Now you can navigate to the source page and click “initialize”. Unbody will index the content from your entry point.
    Once the process is completed, the dashboard will display the number of records processed.
    <Callout type="info">
        Please note that the time taken to index your content depends on the size of your content. You can only start
        interacting with your content once the indexing process is completed.
    </Callout>

    ### Next Steps
    Once the source is initialized, you will see the status of the source as "idle".
    In order to interact with your content. You have a few options as given below:
</Steps>

### Explore the GraphQL Playground

You can directly jump to the GraphQL Playground and get your hands dirty, craft your queries, and watch the magic. You can find the `GraphQL Playground` as middle tab in the top navigation bar on project page.
We have given some tailored examples for Google Drive content.

With the query given below, you can retrieve the name and text content from a Google Doc.

  ```graphql copy
query {
  Get {
    GoogleDoc {
      originalName
      text
    }
  }
}
```

### Use the API directly or with SDKs
In order to be able to interact with the API directly, you first need to obtain an API key. You can find the API key in the project settings / developer settings. You can use the API key to authenticate your requests. You can read more about this on our [Authorization page](/docs/graphql-api/authorization).

# How it works

Nobody reads the content where you store it. All you need to do is tell Unbody where your content is located (e.g., a folder on Google Drive). After that, Unbody indexes and processes all files within the source. You can then access and perform search actions on the enriched version of your content via the GraphQl endpoint using your API-KEY.

The good thing is that after the initial indexing, Unbody keeps listening to changes on your source. As soon as some content changes or a new file is added or deleted, Unbody indexes and processes it instantly. Like any other headless solution, once a change occurs, Unbody sends a notification to your endpoint via the webhook you configure.

You can create as many projects as you want and each project can have as many as sources you need.

So in short:

1. **Connect to your source**
2. **Fetch your (enriched) content via GraphQL endpoint**
3. **Build what you want**

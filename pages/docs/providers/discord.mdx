# Discord
This guide offers strategic insights into connecting Discord to Unbody.

### **Entrypoint** — Selecting a Channel

The entry point for Discord integration is a channel, hence one [source](/docs/getting-started#3-connect-your-content-sources) contains the messages from a single channel. The channel can be a text channel, voice channel, or inside a category.

**Class objects**
- `DiscordMessage`

**Supported Files & Data Types**
- Text messages
- Images
- Videos
- Audio

        ```tsx

                        .discordMessage
                        .select("content", "attachments.TextDocuments.text")
                        .limit(100)
                        .generate
                        .fromMany(
                            "These the last 100 messages on our Discord, Generate a summary of them in a markdown format",
                            ["content", "attachments.TextDocuments.text"]
                        )
                        .execute();
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### **Troubleshooting**
- In order to be able to connect your Discord to Unbody, you need to have the admin role in the server.
- If you are unable to connect your Discord to Unbody, please check if the bot has the necessary permissions to access the channel.
- For private channels, you need to make sure that the bot has access to the channel. You can do this by adding Unbody's bot to the channel.

### **Limitations**
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Currently we can only fetch the last 1000 messages from a channel. We are working on increasing this limit.

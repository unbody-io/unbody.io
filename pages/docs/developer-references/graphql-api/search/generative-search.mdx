# Generative Search

Generative Search is a cutting-edge feature that leverages the capabilities of large language models to enrich and transform query results into engaging narratives. A large language model is a natural language deep learning model that has the ability to process natural language and generate output mimicking humans.

At its core, it takes simple data points and creates content that resonates with human readers. This guide will walk you through the different techniques available in Unbody's Generative Search, showcasing how you can adapt it for a variety of uses.

## Generative Search Techniques at a Glance

Before diving into the specifics, let us overview the different techniques within Unbody's Generative Search.

- **Single Prompt Generative Search**: This search technique tailors individual responses for each data point, ideal for creating unique, context-specific content.
- **Grouped Task Generative Search**: It generates a unified text from a group of data points, perfect for summaries or establishing common themes.
- **Property Selection**: This technique enhances control over the generative process by selecting specific data attributes to include in the generation task, streamlining the content to focus on what's important.

These techniques can be utilized across various domains, whether you're crafting social media posts, summarizing articles, or generating educational content.

Let us explore each of these techniques in more detail.

## Single Prompt Generative Search

Single Prompt Generative Search processes individual items, creating a separate, tailored piece of text for each item. It is ideal for platforms that need to turn database entries or content pieces into appealing, individualized narratives.

Let us take a look at the example.

### Example

Hereâ€™s how you can turn historical facts into questions for social media, using `TextBlock` data.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    TextBlock(nearContent: { concepts: ["World history"] }, limit: 2) {
      content
      _additional {
        generate(
          singleResult: {
            prompt: """
            Transform this historical fact into a captivating tweet: {content}.
            """
          }
        ) {
          singleResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Grouped Task Generative Search

If you need to draw insights or create a narrative that encompasses several data points, Grouped Task Generative Search is the tool for your job. It is particularly effective for summarizing data sets or highlighting trends and commonalities.

Let us explore an example of GTGS.

### Example

To create a collective overview of Australian wildlife based on `TextBlock` entries, you can curate the query as given below.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    TextBlock(nearContent: { concepts: ["Australian wildlife"] }, limit: 3) {
      content
      significance
      _additional {
        generate(
          groupedResult: {
            task: """
            Summarize the common traits of these Australian animals.
            """
            properties: ["content"]
          }
        ) {
          groupedResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Property Selection in Grouped Tasks

Property Selection refines the generative search by focusing on selected data attributes, enhancing the relevance and coherence of the generated content. It is suitable for applications that require a distilled essence of complex information.

Let us take a look at the example of Property Selection.

### Example

To spotlight key features of innovations, you can form your query like the example give below.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    TextBlock(nearContent: { concepts: ["Innovations"] }, limit: 3) {
      content
      significance
      _additional {
        generate(
          groupedResult: {
            task: """
            Highlight the most impactful aspects of these innovations.
            """
            properties: ["content"]
          }
        ) {
          groupedResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

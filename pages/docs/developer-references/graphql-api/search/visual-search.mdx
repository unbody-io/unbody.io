# Visual Search

In the world of images, it would be unfair if you could not search for them in your data. Unbody allows you to search images using Visual Search.

Visual Search operates by comparing a target image against a database to identify similar items. The search is conducted using the `nearImage` or `nearMedia` functions, depending on whether the search is specifically for images or for broader media content, respectively.

## Understanding `nearImage` Search

When you perform a `nearImage` search, you provide a Base64-encoded string of your target image. I know you might be wondering what is Base64-encoding. Base64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into text format. The converted data is used to transfer media files over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This ensures the image can be included directly in the GraphQL query without needing to reference an external resource.

### Performing the Search

The example given below demonstrates the `nearImage` search query.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Image(
      nearImage: {
        image: "base64_encoded_image_string"
        # Additional parameters...
      }
    ) {
      url
      description
      # Other image details...
    }
  }
}
```

- **Obtaining a Base64-encoded Image String**
  There are many tools and libraries in various programming languages that help you encode your image to Base64-encoding. For example, you can use JavaScript to convert the image to Base64-encoding as shown in the examples below.
  ```jsx
  function getBase64(file, callback) {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
    reader.onload = function () {
      const base64String = reader.result
        .replace("data:", "")
        .replace(/^.+,/, "");
      callback(base64String); // Pass the base64 string to the callback
    };
    reader.onerror = function (error) {
      console.log("Error: ", error);
    };
  }

  // Example usage:
  // Assuming you have a file input in your HTML: <input type="file" id="fileInput" />
  const fileInput = document.getElementById("fileInput");

  fileInput.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    getBase64(file, (base64) => {
      console.log(base64); // Here's your base64 string
    });
  });
  ```
  You can also use Pythonâ€™s `base64` library to perform the same task as shown in the example given below.
  ```python
  import base64

  with open("path_to_your_image.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
      encoded_string = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
  ```
  The `encoded_string` is the Base64-encoded string of the image. It can be used as the input to the `image` parameter in the `nearImage` search.

## Parameters for `nearImage` Search

Let us have a look at the parameters you can use with the `nearImage`.

- **image (required)**: This is the Base64-encoded string of the image you're searching for.
- **certainty**: It defined a threshold for the confidence of the model. It means the model has such confidence that the results are similar to the provided image (e.g. 0.8 for 80% certainty).
- **distance**: It denotes how closely the results need to match the search image. The smaller number indicates a closer match.
- **limit**: This parameter limits the maximum number of similar images that the search returns.

### Example of a Full `nearImage` Query

```python
{
  Get {
    Image(
      nearImage: {
        image: "base64_encoded_image_string",
        certainty: 0.8,
        distance: 0.5,
        limit: 10
      }
    ) {
      url
      description
    }
  }
}
```

# Question Answering

The Question and Answer (Q&A) module of Unbody is designed to extract answers from your data, transforming it into a resource for direct query responses.

The Q&A module introduces an `ask {}` operator available in GraphQL `Get` queries. It returns the answer with the highest certainty level, ensuring reliable and accurate responses.

### Default Q&A Module

The default module operates on the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad (uncased)` model, providing a balance between performance and accuracy. It follows a two-step process as given below.

1. **Semantic Search**: It locates documents likely to contain the answer.
2. **Answer Extraction**: It uses BERT-style extraction on text and string properties of the document.

**Outcomes:**

- No answer was found.
- Answer found but below the specified minimum certainty.
- An answer meeting the desired certainty is returned.

For further details, you can refer to the [Weaviate documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/qna-openai).

### OpenAI Q&A Module

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  OpenAIâ€™s Q&A is best suited for complex query contexts or when you require the
  advanced capabilities of OpenAI's models. It provides nuanced and
  context-aware responses, making it a powerful tool for intricate query needs.
</Callout>

Leveraging OpenAIâ€™s `completions endpoint`, this module also adopts a two-step process:

1. **Semantic Search**: Semantic search identifies potential documents.
2. **Answer Generation**: It generates a prompt for OpenAI, which then extracts the answer.

The outcomes are similar to the default module as described above.

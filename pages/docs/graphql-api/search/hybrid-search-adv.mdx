# Hybrid Search - Advanced Guide

The advanced guide for Hybrid Search is helpful for those developers who are comfortable with the basics of Hybrid Search. If you haven’t had the chance to read the basics of Hybrid search, please visit [this page](/docs/graphql-api/search/hybrid-search).

## Fusion (Ranking) Method: Fine-Tune Your Results

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

</Callout>

When you're working with Hybrid Search, the way keyword and vector search results are combined can make a big difference. By default, Unbody uses `rankedFusion`, adding inverted ranks of both search methods. However, if you prefer, you can switch to `relativeScoreFusion` to add normalized scores instead. This option is especially useful when you want to prioritize the relevance of results.

The sample code given below demonstrates how you can do it.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```graphql copy
{
  Get {
    Article(
      limit: 3
      hybrid: { query: "coding in Python", fusionType: relativeScoreFusion }
    ) {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```tsx
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Target Specific Properties: Get Precise

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  NOTE: This feature is available from v1.19.0 onwards
</Callout>

Unbody allows you to focus your search on specific fields of your data. you can target particular properties for the keyword portion of your search. Moreover, this doesn't affect the vector search, ensuring your semantic search remains broad and context-aware. Liked that? I guess, yesss!!

Take a look at the example given below.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```graphql copy
{
  Get {
    Article(
      limit: 3
      hybrid: { query: "coding in Python", properties: ["title"], alpha: 0.25 }
    ) {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```tsx
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Boosting Properties: Give Priority Where Needed

Isn’t it true that some things deserve more attention than others? Well, the same is true for data. Sometimes, certain parts of your data might be more important than others. With property weighting, you can tell Unbody to give more importance to specific fields during the BM25 keyword search.

You can write a query as given below.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```graphql copy
{
  Get {
    Article(
      limit: 3
      hybrid: {
        query: "coding"
        properties: ["title^2", "content"]
        alpha: 0.25
      }
    ) {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```tsx
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

In the example given above, Unbody’s Hybrid Search considers matches in the title to be twice as important as matches in the content.

## Bring Your Own Vectors: Customized Semantic Search

Have you got your own vector? Great! You can provide it directly to the Hybrid Search and Unbody will use it for the vector part of the search. It will still consider your query string for the keyword search. This is perfect for when you have a very specific semantic context in mind.

The example given below shows you how you can form a query with your own vector.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```graphql copy
{
  Get {
    Article(
      limit: 3
      hybrid: {
        query: "coding in Python"
        vector: [...your_vector_here...]
      }
    ) {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```tsx
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add a Conditional Filter: Refine Your Search

You can add conditional filters to your hybrid search queries. These filters will refine the results without impacting the ranking. For example, if you want to search for articles about "coding in Python" but only if they are tagged as "tutorials", you can write the query as given below.

<Tabs items={['GraphQL', 'TypeScript']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```graphql copy
{
  Get {
    Article(
      limit: 3
      hybrid: { query: "coding in Python" }
      where: { path: ["tags"], operator: Equal, valueText: "tutorial" }
    ) {
      title
      content
      tags
    }
  }
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```tsx
// TypeScript code is coming soon...
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

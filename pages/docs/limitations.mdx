## **Limitations**

Unbody is a powerful content management solution, but it has certain limitations that users should be aware of. Here are a few things that Unbody cannot do and is not good for:

### **Limited schema customisability**

Unbody is designed to be simple and straightforward to use, but that also means that it is not as customizable as other CMS solutions. While you can use your favorite web development tools and frameworks to build the rest of your website, the options for customization may be limited.

### **Limited access control**

Unbody currently processes and exposes any content from its entry-points, such as a folder on Google Drive, via its content API. While the content is protected by an API key, Unbody does not currently distinguish between private or public sources. This means that if your source of content includes both private and public folders, Unbody will expose the content in both folders via its content API protected by the API key.

**It's important to keep in mind that Unbody is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it may not be the best choice for certain types of projects. However, for simple to moderate complexity content, Unbody can be an efficient and cost-effective way to manage website content, but it is not suitable for projects where access control is a critical requirement.**

{/* Welcome to the Unbody documentation! Here you'll find everything you need to get started with Unbody, from setting up your account to integrating our AI functionalities into your applications. */}


### What is Unbody?
Unbody.io is an AI-as-a-service platform that streamlines AI development by integrating data from multiple sources and applying various AI models through a single API. It simplifies the process of building AI-powered applications like chatbots, generative search, and intelligent search engines, making it accessible with just one line of code. Unbody supports flexible AI engine choices, data formats, and sources, allowing developers to quickly deploy AI features without needing deep expertise in AI development.

### Why Unbody?
As AI-driven experiences become standard across digital platforms, users increasingly anticipate intelligent functionalities in every app and website. However, the tools for this are often too complex, especially when handling private data. This complexity means that many developers—probably like yourself—find it challenging to build or integrate AI features into their projects.
- Unbody simplifies this process to a single line of code.
- Makes adding advanced AI features (e.g., chatbots, semantic search) as easy as adding a new page to a website.

### How Does Unbody Work?

Unbody works in 3 essential steps:
1. **Tell Unbody Where Your Data Is**: Integrate data from sources like Google Drive, SharePoint, Slack, or local files (documents, spreadsheets, images, videos) to centralize and simplify data access.
2. **Choose Your Preferred AI Engine**: Select from a variety of AI models, including OpenAI's GPT, Gemini, or open-source models from Hugging Face, to personalize AI features for your needs.
3. **Start Building Now**: Unbody aggregates, syncs, and transforms your data into ready-to-use AI functionalities, accessible via a single GraphQL endpoint or SDK.

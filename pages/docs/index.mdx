# Overview

Welcome to Unbody, your premier solution for transforming diverse content from any location or format into accessible, enriched knowledge. This overview provides a snapshot of how Unbody operates, ensuring that your proprietary content is always ready for interaction.

### **1. Continuous Aggregation and Synchronization**

At the heart of Unbody is our ability to continuously aggregate and synchronize content from a wide variety of sources. Whether it's documents from Google Drive, messages from Slack, or files from a local folder, Unbody ensures that your content is not just collected once, but constantly kept up to date with any changes or additions.

**Providers**: Providers are the channels through which content can be aggregated and synchronized with Unbody. These include, but are not limited to, Google Drive, Google Calendar, local folders, Dropbox, Discord, Slack, Telegram chat, GitHub, and more.

**Files**: Unbody can aggregate and synchronize various types of files including text documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, images, and videos. For instance, a PDF file in Google Drive, an image shared in a Slack channel, or a video file in a local folder can all be continuously synced to Unbody.

### **2. Content Analysis and Enhancement**

Once the content is aggregated and synchronized, Unbody’s suite of AI models analyze and enrich the content to transform it into a queryable knowledge base. This involves processes like entity extraction, sentiment analysis, image captioning, and more.

### **3. Knowledge Delivery via API**

The transformed and enriched content is then made accessible via Unbody’s APIs. Unbody provides various APIs, including a Content API based on GraphQL, an Image API, and a Video API, to deliver this knowledge in a format that’s ready for application development and interaction.

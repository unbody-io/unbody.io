title: Content Strategist & Writer (Freelance)

## Hey, Storyteller! ðŸ‘‹

At Unbody, weâ€™re not just developing another platform. Weâ€™re carving out a new universe in content management â€“ one that's intuitive, fluid, and super smart. You up for a challenge to help us share this vision?

### Whatâ€™s the Gig?

With our public debut on the horizon, we're after a content strategist & writer whoâ€™s as obsessed with crafting narratives as we are with reshaping the content landscape. And hey, we're on a tight schedule - our timeline runs up to WebSummit 2023.

### What's on Your Plate?

1. Craft a kickass content plan that matches our energy, leading up to the public launch.
2. Pen down engaging stories, blog posts, and other cool stuff.
3. Refine what weâ€™ve got, like our white paper draft, making it shine.
4. Keep our brand voice sounding like, well, us.

### Bring to the Table:

- Killer content strategy and writing chops.
- Some experience or fascination with web development or CMSs (the more, the merrier!).
- An undying urge to dive deep into what we're about and reflect that in the content.

### The Sweet Stuff:

*This is a freelance role, and your deep understanding of Unbodyâ€™s essence is key. Show us that magic when you apply!* 

*We're a small, passionate team. In this role, you'll enjoy a significant degree of autonomy, working closely with our founder to lay the foundational stones of Unbody's content and marketing strategy.*

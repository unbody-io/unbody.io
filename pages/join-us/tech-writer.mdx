title: Technical Writer for API & Dashboard Documentation (Freelance)
---

### Tech Guru Alert!

At Unbody, we’re building something epic – and guess what? We want our users to understand every bit of it. Think you can break down our tech magic into easy bites?

### What’s the Deal?

We're on the hunt for a tech-savvy writer who’s great with words and better with codes. Dive into a two-phased mission: creating an outline and then co-authoring the ultimate content. And oh, our engines are revved up for a 2-month sprint.

### Your To-Do List:

1. Work on the outline, revisiting our GraphQL API, dashboard, features, and tutorials.
2. Co-write the content, transforming tech jargons into sweet, comprehensible pieces.

### Your Toolkit Should Have:

- Pro technical writing skills, especially when it comes to API and dashboards.
- A knack for making complicated things sound simple.
- Flexibility and a love for collaboration.

### Bonus Points:

*Freelancers, listen up! For phase one, we'll settle on a fixed rate. As we progress, we'll switch to hourly or word-based rates. And hey, showing off your Unbody understanding? Totally worth it.*

## Join Unbody: Lead the Charge as Our Developer Advocate

Hey Developer Advocate ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¥·

Unbody is forging the future of headless CMSs, distinguished as the first to be entirely grounded in vector databases, seamlessly integrated with LLMs and the power of machine learning.

We're searching for a JAMstack and headless CMS aficionado who's also passionate about the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning. But more than just a Developer Advocate, we want someone who's eager to hop aboard on a riveting journey with us, even if it's just for a chapter or two.

**What Youâ€™d Dive Into**:

- **Crafting Narratives**: Blend technical depth with storytelling. Dive deep into Unbody's potential through case studies, articles, and community dialogues.
- **Community Leadership**: Amplify Unbodyâ€™s ethos in the developer and AI community, be our voice in workshops, webinars, and our GitHub space.
- **Steer Strategy**: In our tight-knit team, your insights matter. Contribute to key strategic decisions, embodying our commitment to transparency.

**Who We're Looking For**:

- Knowledge enthusiast with a grasp on JAMstack, headless CMSs, and a spark for LLMs and AI.
- Engaging communicator with a penchant for fostering community ties.
- Collaborative spirit, eager to shape and share in Unbody's journey.

**Contractual Specifics**:

This role is initially a freelance gig, aligned with our ambitious public launch campaign for the upcoming WebSummit 2023. Should the stars align, there's potential for this to morph into a full-time position down the line. And guess what? As part of this collaboration, we've reserved a spot for you to join us at WebSummit!

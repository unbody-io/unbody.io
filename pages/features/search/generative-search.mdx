Unbody's Semantic and Contextual Search feature combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Weaviate, a potent vector database, to deliver multimodal semantic search capabilities. This feature transcends the boundaries of traditional keyword-based searches and understands the context and the intent of your queries, offering an unparalleled content discovery experience.
